3. CRUD Javascript App: View Page

Description: In this work, you have to make a simple presentation part of a website - View Page (You can find the template of the page by following the link - https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/view/lviv-iot-crud-js-app

For your blocks you must use data from your java/python project class.

In case you don’t have a data from previous year, you should choose any free task from this link: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RW9PpalOlHn-nVIi8kbCr71vu_XLNsjj4TKpTdBnZ-w/edit?usp=sharing

Then using JavaScript, you need to implement the following operations on your data (it is up to you to decide which field should be used for each of the operations): 
Sort of your items option
Search option 
Count total amount of some of the field 
(e.g total price of all cars)

Requirements:
Responsiveness absolutely not required.
Styling is not important at all. Is up to you.

Our recommendations and tips:
use JS Array methods: map(), sort(), filter(), reduce()
use native JS for any DOM operations (querySelector | findById | insertAdjacentHTML | etc)

4. CRUD Javascript App: Create/Edit Pages

Description: In this work, you need to continue working and add two new parts to your website - Create & Edit Pages (You can find the template of these pages by following the link)

Update/Delete operations are not required for this work!

Also you must validate the forms using HTML attributes (inputs must be configured for your data format).
If incorrect data is entered in the inputs, you must use JavaScript to inform the user with modal windows or just plain alert() function.

Bonus points are provided for this work, if you implement a styled modal window that will work with JavaScript.

Requirements:
Responsiveness absolutely not required.
Styling is not important at all. Is up to you.

5. CRUD Javascript App: Backend

Description: In the last part of working on the website you have to implement all Create/Read/Update/Delete operations which must be made via the corresponding HTTP methods in your REST API.

Important. You don't have to make a backend from the beginning - connect an existing one that you worked on in the first year.
If you don’t have a backend server, you should create a new REST API using any preferred technology.
